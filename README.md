# Braille-Text-to-Speech-using-CNN
Those who are not blind or visually disabled usually use their eyes to read braille. Despite what many people think, braille is not a language. It is a code that allows for the writing and reading of several languages, including English, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, and many more. Thousands of individuals use braille in their native tongues all across the world, which increases access to reading.

Dataset Preparation:-
Every image in the collection has a BW scale of 28 by 28 pixels. Each picture name is composed of the alphabetic characters, the image number, and the kind of data augmentation that was applied to it (e.g., whs stands for width height shift, rot for rotation, dim for brightness). The dataset consists of three augmentations, three sets of characters, and twenty distinct pictures with varying augmentation values (i.e., shift, rotational, and brightness values). There are 26 classes or little English letters from A to z.
