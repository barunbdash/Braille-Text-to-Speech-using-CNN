Those who are not blind or visually disabled usually use their eyes to read braille. Despite what many people think, braille is not a language. It is a code that allows for the writing and reading of several languages, including English, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, and many more. Thousands of individuals use braille in their native tongues all across the world, which increases access to reading.
